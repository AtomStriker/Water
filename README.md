Source code for a personal Discord bot that made using Discord.js.
This respository was made for source control purposes (**might** publicise later).

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- (Optionally) [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Setup

> At the moment, you have to host the bot yourself, since I don't have it hosted anywhere yet.

1. Clone the repository using git or download the ZIP file through Github and extract it.
2. `cd` into the repository.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Host your own bot through the [Discord Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and grab its token.
5. Create a `config.json` file and paste in the following code:
  
   ```json
   {
    "token": "your-bot-token",
    "prefix": "~", // you can change the prefix to whatever you prefer
   }
   ```

6. Replace the text in `"your-bot-token"` with the token of the bot that you created in in the 4th step.
7. Run the bot using `node index.js` in your terminal.
